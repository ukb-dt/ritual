**The Dude’s entire "persistence stack" = ritual** … and the plot starts when it’s kicked out from under him.

* **Ritual baseline (9-o’clock / Persistence):** bowling nights, White Russians, baths, Creedence, and — emblematic — **the rug** that “really tied the room together.”
* **Disruption (entropy spike, 6-o’clock):** rug desecration → his steady-state gets noise injected.
* **Computation (soma splice):** the system tries to restore homeostasis (get a rug) but escalates into a mythic quest.
* **Social/Myth rewrite:** the Dude becomes a reluctant protagonist precisely because his rituals were upended.

It’s the same skeleton across your trio:

* **Falstaff:** chivalric *honour* ritual says “die nobly”; he rejects it (chooses discretion).
* **Hamlet:** court/funeral/wedding rites are scrambled (“thrift, thrift”), then a **ghost** hijacks the ritual layer with “remember me.”
* **The Dude:** quotidian rituals shattered → narrative ignition.

If you want the neuron to show this cleanly, add an **exogenous shock** into the 9-o’clock branch:

* a tiny label “RUG / RITE / ORDER” on the 9-o’clock dendrite,
* a thin red arrow from outside the circle into that branch, caption: **RITUAL BREACH**,
* and a faint pulse traveling to the soma (dashed glow) to signal error → action.

TL;DR: stories begin when **rituals (persistence)** break. Your diagram reads perfectly: **persistence node perturbed → soma computes → new policy down the axon.**
